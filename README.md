# SigMapDrone

This is an Android app that I made for my senior design project in college.  It reads cellular and wifi data and stores them locally in a sqlite database.  There is also functionality to export this data manually to the public downloads folder of the phone and also up to a firebase database.  The app was also supposed to read in location data over USB from a Pozyx system, but that functionality was not completed.
